# React vs. Blazor

This demo shows how React apps can live together with Blazor apps, which are basically C# apps running in the browser with the help of WebAssembly.

## Getting started

To configure Blazor on your machine, you can follow the [instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) online. For the rest, you only need:

```
npm install
```

### Build

To build the project and run it locally run

```
npm run build
npm start
```

Then you can access it at `http://localhost:8080/react-blazor/`.
